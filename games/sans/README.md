This is a game made by Jcw87

This simulator made by Jcw87 was written in Construct 2, so you couldn't immediately deploy the version made by JC <em>but</em>
I have converted this game into HTML5.
All you have to do is get free web hosting (000webhost.com) and then drag and drop these files into public_html via FTP, and you have a working version of the Sans fight!

You can also deploy it on Netlify, Vercel, or any static site deployment service.

Netlify:

Vercel:

Simply fork this repository and deploy it on Netlify or Vercel, and have a bad time!
